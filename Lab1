# This SQL program utilizes the 'classicmodels' schema in MySQL Workbench.

# Objective 1: How many rows are in the Orders table?

  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM classicmodels.orders;

# Objective 2: List all columns for all orders in reverse numerical order(largest to smallest)
#              by order number in the Orders table. Limit output to the first 5 rows.

  SELECT *
  FROM classicmodels.orders
  ORDER BY orderNumber DESC

# Objective 3: What are the earliest and latest order dates in the Orders table?

  Select MIN(orderDate), MAX(orderDate) FROM classicmodels.orders;
  
# Objective 4: List employee first names in alphabetical order and a count of employees that
#              have each first name.

# Objective 5: What orders do NOT have a status of "Cancelled"? Sort by order number.

Select orderNumber FROM classicmodels.orders

# Objective 6: Update Steve Patterson's first name to Steven in the employees table.
#             Ensure that your update will not change a person whose first name is Steve
#             but whose last name is not Patterson.

UPDATE classicmodels.employees

WHERE (employeeNumber = 1216);

# Objective 7: List customer name, contact last name, contact first name, phone, city, and
