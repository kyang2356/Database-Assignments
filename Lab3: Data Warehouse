# This SQL program utilizes the 'sakila' and 'sakila_dw' schemas in MySQL Workbench.
# This program include the exploration of the data warehouse(sakila_dw)
# Each Objective will include queries for the transactional database and the data warehouse database

# Objective 1: List store id, film title, and a count of how many times each film 
was rented at each store in 2006.  Sort by store id then film title.
